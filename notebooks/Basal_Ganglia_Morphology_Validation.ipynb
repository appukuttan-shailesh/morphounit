The user decides whether to run the validations for all available morphologies, or a subset of these.\n","<br /><br />\n","The validations are carried out using 'NeuroM' (https://github.com/BlueBrain/NeuroM). The validation test evaluates the morphology in two stages:\n","<br /><br />\n","1. **Hard Constraints**<br />\n","\n","   Here we evaluate the integrity of the neuronal reconstruction in order to determine if it is appropriate for further evaluations. The evaluations here can be sub-divided into the following NeuroM features (apps):\n","   \n","   - morph_check\n","   - cut_plane_detection <br /><br />\n","   \n","2. **Soft Constraints** [Currently only available for *Fast Spiking Interneurons*]<br />\n","\n","Neuronal reconstructions that pass the 'Hard Constraints' are evaluated here for their morphometric features. The features are extracted using NeuroM's morph_stats app, wherever possible, either directly or as a combination of multiple features. These are then compared against experimentally obtained data, as determined by the particular validation test being executed.\n","<br />  \n","Some of the features currently included are soma's diameter and the maximal branch order in the dendrites, besides the number of trunk sections, -X,Y,Z- extents, field's diameter and total path-length of both the axon and the dendrites.\n","<br /><br />\n","**Note**: Currently only FS interneurons can be considered, since observation data is missing for other neuron types.\n"," </div>"]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 1.
